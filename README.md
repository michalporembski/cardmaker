#Cardmaker

##About

This is some old symfony application that I've created so long ago, and never cared to maintain.

As now I have some free time, and it would be nice to have something on github I will try to clean it a little. We will see what can be done with old legacy code.

Main purpose of this app is generation of custom cards to some old board game.

##Set up:

to set up please check out this repo:

`https://github.com/michalporembski/cardmaker_docker`

##TODO:

* Update symfony version
* Add text sanitation/validation to front page
* clean unused mess (hero entity?)
* add fallback for running application without resources
* add command for resources validation
* add unit tests
* move generated card images to other folder `var generated` (?)
* extract card generation to separate bundle
* add button to disable auto line breaks
